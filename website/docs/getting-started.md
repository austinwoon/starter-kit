# Getting Started

We have deliberately designed the set-up process to take care of the
hosting of your product first. This allows you to take advantage of the
automation that is provided by some of the services that you will use. It
will also host the start of your codebase on GitHub, for you to work on 
at a later point.

## Objectives

This guide, the first part of two, will take you through the following steps:
- Obtaining services for hosting
- Deploying to Vercel

By the end of this guide, you will have:
- A database to hold information that your product needs to function
- A copy of the Starter Kit codebase hosted on GitHub
- A copy of Starter Kit deployed to a managed hosting service

## Obtaining Services

We will obtain a couple of items for our hosted environment:
- A database service, to hold information for your product
- A key to access the API from [Postman](https://www.postman.gov.sg),
  for sending emails, including emails for logging into your product
